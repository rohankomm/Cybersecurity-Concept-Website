    <!-- Overview -->
    <h5>Overview</h5>
    <p>Cybersecurity threats are various malicious activities aimed at compromising the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Both businesses and individuals face these threats daily, making it crucial to understand them and implement adequate protective measures.</p>

    <!-- Malware -->
    <h5>Malware</h5>
    <p>Malware, or malicious software, is designed to harm or exploit any programmable device, service, or network. Types of malware include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Viruses:</strong> Attach themselves to clean files and spread throughout a computer system, damaging files and programs.</li>
      <li><strong>Worms:</strong> Spread across networks without needing a host file, often exploiting vulnerabilities in operating systems.</li>
      <li><strong>Trojans:</strong> Disguised as legitimate software, they can create backdoors for attackers once installed.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Ransomware -->
    <h5>Ransomware</h5>
    <p>Ransomware is a type of malware that encrypts files on a victim's device, rendering them inaccessible until a ransom is paid. Preventive measures include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Regular Data Backups:</strong> Keep backups of important files on external devices or secure cloud services.</li>
      <li><strong>Software Updates:</strong> Regularly update software and operating systems to patch vulnerabilities.</li>
      <li><strong>Security Software:</strong> Use reputable antivirus and anti-malware solutions to detect and block ransomware.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Social Engineering -->
    <h5>Social Engineering</h5>
    <p>Social engineering involves manipulating individuals into divulging confidential information. Common tactics include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Impersonation:</strong> Attackers pose as trusted figures (like IT support) to gain sensitive information.</li>
      <li><strong>Deceptive Emails:</strong> Emails designed to appear legitimate that trick users into revealing personal information.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Insider Threats -->
    <h5>Insider Threats</h5>
    <p>Insider threats occur when employees or contractors intentionally or unintentionally compromise security. This can involve:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Negligence:</strong> Employees may inadvertently expose sensitive data due to lack of training or awareness.</li>
      <li><strong>Malicious Intent:</strong> Disgruntled employees may intentionally leak or steal data.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) -->
    <h5>Denial of Service (DoS) and Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)</h5>
    <p>DoS and DDoS attacks overwhelm a network or server with traffic, rendering it unusable. Methods to mitigate these attacks include:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Implement robust firewalls to filter traffic and block malicious requests.</li>
      <li><strong>Anti-DDoS Services:</strong> Use specialized services to absorb and mitigate DDoS attacks before they reach your network.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Real-World Examples -->
    <h5>Real-World Examples</h5>
    <p>Understanding past incidents can help organizations prepare for potential threats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>WannaCry Ransomware Attack (2017):</strong> A global ransomware attack that affected hundreds of thousands of computers, demanding payment in Bitcoin.</li>
      <li><strong>Target Data Breach (2013):</strong> Cybercriminals used stolen credentials to access Target's network, compromising millions of credit card accounts.</li>
      <li><strong>GitHub DDoS Attack (2018):</strong> A significant DDoS attack that peaked at 1.35 Tbps, one of the largest recorded, which GitHub successfully mitigated.</li>
    </ul>

    <!-- Practical Tips -->
    <h5>Practical Tips</h5>
    <p>Hereâ€™s a checklist of best practices to protect against cybersecurity threats:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Regular Software Updates:</strong> Keep all systems and software up to date.</li>
      <li><strong>Employee Training:</strong> Conduct regular cybersecurity training to educate staff on recognizing threats.</li>
      <li><strong>Data Encryption:</strong> Encrypt sensitive data both at rest and in transit.</li>
      <li><strong>Incident Response Plan:</strong> Develop and maintain a robust incident response plan for potential breaches.</li>
      <li><strong>Engage with Cybersecurity Organizations:</strong> Connect with organizations like the Cybersecurity & Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) for resources and support.</li>
    </ul>
